# Blood 1 rearrangements for orchestra (2007-2008)

From July 2007-2008 I had finally completed rearranging the music of blood 1. And yes, I called it rearranged back then, but this is of course no rearrangement in the traditional, ordinary sense. Still, the compositions are so damn good and most parts were already for orchestra, so I edited the files in order to improve the sound. Events such as note velocities or track volumes have been adjusted accordingly. Instruments like the timpani have been added to many tracks to create richer sound.

Quite some minor corrections to my arrangements and soundfonts are needed, but all midi files were lost because of human mistake (the arrangements are still there) so I am not up to redo everything again. This project shall therefore be deemed completed.
Addendum 2018: I discovered the old midi files on a backup CD. So this project is on my to-do list again. WID.

Many thanks to the gifted Guy Whitmore, Daniel Bernstein and Mike Cody, they have masterly composed the music for the blood series.
