# Blood 1 rearrangements for orchestra (2007)

In July 2007 working many moons rearranging the music of blood 1 has been completed. This is no full rearrangement mostly because the compositions are so well.

Quite some minor corrections to my arrangements and soundfonts are needed, but all midi files were lost because of human mistake (the arrangements are still there) so I am not up to redo everything again. This project shall therefore be deemed completed.

Most midis were edited in order to improve arrangement management and sound. Events such as note velocities or track volumes have been adjusted accordingly. Instruments like the Timpani has been added to many tracks to create richer sound.
